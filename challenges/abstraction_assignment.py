# Requirements:
# create a class that utilizes the concept of abstraction
# 1. your class should contain abstract and regular methods
# 2. create a child class the defines the implementation of parent's abstract method
# 3. create an object that utilizes both parent and child methods
# 4. add comments throughout your code

  # regular method

    self.alive = False

class Fish(LifeForm):

# object uses parent & child methods
