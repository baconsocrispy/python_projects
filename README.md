# python_projects

## Introduction

The projects in this repository were created as part of the Python Course I took through The Tech Academy in June 2022. It contains challenges and exercises as part of learning the language as well as basic Django projects created as an introduction to the framework.


## Django Projects

* Hotel Management App
* Checkbook App

### Hotel Management App

As an introductory walk-through of the Django framework, we created a simple app that allows users to add, delete and update food items that are available at a hotel. The project laid out the basics of setting up virtual environments, initializing a Django project, adding apps within the project and the basic file structure and functionality of the framework.

### Checkbook App

Following the Hotel Management App, we created another simple Django app that allows users to create a bank account, add transactions and see their balance sheet history. It reinforced many of the fundamental concepts introduced in the previous exercise, including the interdependency of urls, views and templates, as well as the Django Template Language.
